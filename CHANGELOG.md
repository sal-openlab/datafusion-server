* Fixed an issue where the schema for the `Map` data type was not being generated correctly

## 0.13.2 (2024-05-11) - Quick patch to keep up with the DataFusion crate

* Updates to DataFusion v38.0.0
    + https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/main/dev/changelog/38.0.0.md
* Accepts named session identifier in `/session/create` endpoint
    + It is now possible to specify any arbitrary identifier string instead of
      the generated UUID for the session ID
    + If the `id` query parameter is omitted, the behavior will be the same as before

```sh
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:4000/session/create?id=example-session1
```

This allows for session access using a named identifier.

```sh
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4000/session/example-session1/query \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/sql'
     ...
```

## 0.13.1 (2024-05-10)

* Fixed an issue where locations for Parquet and CSV formats were not functioning correctly over http(s)

## 0.13.0 (2024-05-06)

* Generalized the transport layer across various data source formats including data source
  connector plugins
    + Please refer to this
      [document](https://sal-openlab.github.io/datafusion-server/data-source/what-datasource/#data-source-format-and-location-matrix)
      for a list of available data source formats and locations
    + This adaptation has made it possible to implement data source connector plugins that
      pass through data, such as SMB/CIFS clients (`bin/plugins/datasource-plugin-smb` for details)

```json
{
  "format": "parquet",
  "name": "population",
  "location": "smb://server/shred-folder/population.parquet",
  "pluginOptions": {
    "user": "foo",
    "password": "bar"
  }
}
```

* The session query endpoint (`/session/:id/query`) now supports `application/sql` in addition to
  the previously supported `application/json` in the request headers

```sh
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4000/session/6d72252b-f8d7-4d5a-b73e-962ede7eea4f/query \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/sql' \
     -H 'Accept: text/csv' \
     -d $'
SELECT t1.foo, t2.bar, t2.baz
FROM table1 t1, table2 t2
WHERE t1.id = t2.id
ORDER BY t1.id
'
```

## 0.12.1 (2024-04-30)

* The content-type of multipart fields generated by a browser's form element cannot be specified,
  but files in Parquet format default to `application/octet-stream`
    + If the format cannot be determined from the content-type of a multipart field,
      it will be resolved based on the file name extension
* An example of selecting and uploading multiple files from a browser to the
  `example/multipart-uploader` directory has been provided

## 0.12.0 (2024-04-29)

* Direct file uploads from the client using multipart/form-data
    + POST `/session/:id/datasource/upload` endpoint
    + Supported formats are `text/csv`, `application/json` and `application/vnd.apache.parquet`
    + The maximum upload size is specified by `session.upload_limit_size` in config.toml (default is 20MB)

```sh
$ curl -X POST \
    -F "apis=@./bin/data/public-apis.parquet;type=application/vnd.apache.parquet" \
    -F "store=@./bin/data/superstore.csv;type=text/csv" \
    -F "james_bond=@./bin/data/james-bond.json;type=application/json" \
    http://127.0.0.1:4000/session/e4d8cd37-f9ee-4a5d-981b-2925167a3576/datasource/upload
```

## 0.11.1 (2024-04-23)

* Updates to DataFusion v37.1.0
    + https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/main/dev/changelog/37.1.0.md

## 0.11.0 (2024-04-18)

* Supports complex data types, such as  `List`, `Map`, `Struct` and others
    + Please refer to
      the [Documentation](https://sal-openlab.github.io/datafusion-server/data-source/definition-basics/#complex-data-types)
      for details
* [Breaking] The specifications for the following data type definitions have been changed due to the expansion of
  complex data types
    + Timestamp, TimestampSecond, TimestampMicro, TimestampNano
    + Duration, DurationSecond, DurationMicro, DurationNano
* Avro data source format supported

```sh
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4000/dataframe/query \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'Accept: text/csv' \
     -d $'
{
  "dataSources": [
    {
      "format": "avro",
      "name": "popular_names",
      "location": "file:///popular-names.avro"
    }
  ]
  "query": {
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM popular_names"
  }
}'
```

In this version, only read is supported, and save at the `/session/:id/datasource/save` endpoint is not possible.

## 0.10.2 (2024-04-13)

* Substantially reduced memory consumption during query execution given these conditions:
    + API endpoints are `/session/:id/query` and `/dataframe/query`, or Arrow Flight `do_get()` method
    + The response format is `arrow` (`application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream`)
    + No post-processor (`query.postProcessors` in request body) is specified
* Implements and refactored Arrow Flight gRPC methods:
    + `get_flight_info()`, `get_schema()`, `do_get()`
* Fixed an issue where the post-processor was not working at the `/dataframe/query` endpoint
* Published example code demonstrating how to use it:
    + Data visualization on the web using [Perspective Viewer](https://perspective.finos.org/), Can quickly and easily
      visualize Arrow responses from DataFusion Server
        - Located at `example/perspective-viewer` directory, Simply show `viewer.html` in a web browser
    + Arrow Flight command-line client
        - Located at `example/flight-client` directory, `cargo run` to show usages guide
* Lowered the MSRV to 1.74 and tested all features

## 0.10.1 (2024-04-05)

* Updates to DataFusion v35 and Arrow v51
    + https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/main/dev/changelog/36.0.0.md
    + https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#5100-2024-03-15
* And other related crates
    + Tonic v0.11.0

## 0.10.0 (2024-03-29)

* Initially supported Arrow Flight gRPC feature
* Query or query and response format schema can be specified for request body of endpoint `/:session/query`
* Updates latest crates dependencies
    + Tokio v1.37.0, axum v0.7.5, reqwest v0.12.2 and other crates

## 0.9.2 (2024-03-10)

* Changes argument of entry function from config file path to `struct` of `Settings`
    + Usage example in [README.md (Example of src/main.rs)](README.md#example-of-srcmainrs)
* Updates Python interpreter to v3.11.8 (pre-built Docker container)
* Updates pandas for processor plugin to v2.2.1 (pre-built Docker container)
    + Refactors Python plugin codes (example, excel, pivot-table)
* Updates some dependent crates

## 0.9.1 (2024-02-23)

* Updates latest crates dependencies
    + hyper v1.2.0, tower-https v0.5.2, pyo3 v0.20.3
* Fixes containers version obtaining file in make-containers.sh (to same as crate version)
* Updates README.md

## 0.9.0 (2024-02-21)

* Response format can now be specified via the `Accept` request header.
  If `response.format` is also specified in the request body, the request body takes precedence.
    + This applies to both the `dataframe/query` and `session/:session_id/query` endpoints.

In this example, specifying `csv` for `response.format` will result in the same response.

```sh
$ curl -X "POST" "http://127.0.0.1:4000/dataframe/query" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'Accept: text/csv' \
     -d $'{
  "dataSources": [
    {
      "name": "entry",
      "format": "parquet",
      "location": "file:///public-apis.parquet"
    }
  ]
  "query": {
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM entry"
  }
}'
```

If both `response.format` is specified in the `Accept` header and in the request body,
the specification in `response.format` takes precedence. In this example, the response will be returned in
Arrow format (`Content-Type: application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream`).

```sh
$ curl -X "POST" "http://127.0.0.1:4000/dataframe/query" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -d $'{
  "dataSources": [
    {
      "name": "entry",
      "format": "parquet",
      "location": "file:///public-apis.parquet"
    }
  ]
  "query": {
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM entry"
  },
  response: {
    "format": "arrow"
  }
}'
```

* Updates to DataFusion v36
    + https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/main/dev/changelog/36.0.0.md

## 0.8.16 (2024-02-20)

* Raw JSON is now called ndJSON (new-line delimited JSON), so the data source format specification was changed
  from `rawJson` to `ndJson`.
    + In conjunction with this change, the related sections have been changed.

E.g., Until now,

```json
{
  "dataSources": [
    {
      "format": "rawJson",
      "name": "table1",
      "location": "file:///Superstore.raw.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

From now on,

```json
{
  "dataSources": [
    {
      "format": "ndJson",
      "name": "table1",
      "location": "file:///Superstore.ndjson"
    }
  ]
}
```

The response format will still be suitable for `json`.

```json
{
  "response": {
    "format": "json"
  }
}
```

## 0.8.15 (2024-02-18)

* Wrong information was given in the README.md example. Very sorry...
    + `dataSources[*].location` requires scheme like a `file://`.

## 0.8.0 (2023-08-05) - Introducing built-in merge tables processor

* Built-in merge tables processor feature
    + Merges row and column direction from multiple tables
    + For more details, further reading openapi.v1.yaml

#### Row direction merge

Example tables

```
table1        table2        table3

 id title      id title      id title
--- --------  --- --------  --- --------
  1 title1     10 title11    11 title11
  2 title2     11 title12    12 title12
  3 title3
```

Request

```json
{
  "processor": {
    "mergeProcessors": [
      {
        "direction": "row",
        "baseTable": "table1",
        "targetTables": [
          "table2",
          "table3"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

After Processed

```
table1

 id title
--- --------
  1 title1
  2 title2
  3 title3
 10 title10
 11 title11
 11 title11
 12 title12
```

If the `distinct` option has enabled like follows

```json
{
  "processor": {
    "mergeProcessors": [
      {
        "direction": "row",
        "baseTable": "table1",
        "targetTables": [
          "table2",
          "table3"
        ],
        "options": {
          "distinct": true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then,

```
table1

 id title
--- --------
  1 title1
  2 title2
  3 title3
 10 title10
 11 title11
 12 title12
```

Constraints

* All tables must have exactly the same schema

#### Column direction merge
